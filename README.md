M65 Assembly Library
--------------------

This is the initial draft of my M65 Assembly Library where I've been collecting routines / algorithms. It's still going frequent updates / alterations so please update frequently. 

Please feel free to submit PR's for routines you'ld like to see added. 


NOTE: The assembler used is currently Acme.  This may change in a future release. 
Future revisions are likely to break any macro APIs. 

This library should be considered extremely beta.
