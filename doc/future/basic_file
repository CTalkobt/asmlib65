Basic File & Disk handling
===============================
Implement methods to perform basic file handling similar to how CBM Basic does it. 

Eg: 
  +open_write 1,8,1,"filename,s"

  +open_read .lfn,.dev,.secondary,"filename"
    
  +print_lfn, "text"
    Similar to print#<lfn>,"text"
  +read_line .lfn, .max_len, .address
    Read a line of text or up to .max_len and store at .address. 
  +close 1

  +bsave "filename",bank,start,end or "filename",bank,start,length
    Save file from memory.
  +bload "filename" or "filename",bank,start
    Load file into memory.
  +drive_error ? 
    Retrieve drive error status (ds$)
  +directory ?
    Retrieve directory. 

Future / Not in Scope: +scratch, +collect, +copy ....
