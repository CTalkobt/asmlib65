Tiny "Allocate"
=====================================================
Only allow for allocation of up to 255 bytes. 

Implementation:
---------------

Save the contents of a zp ptr to the stack and then set that to inside the stack where I've allocated the space. The free routine would then restore the contents of the zp ptr and free up the stack allocation.  

Routines:
---------
  - +talloc zp_address, size
    Saves contents of zp_address ptr on the stack. 
	Push byte address of zp_address
    Then allocates given size on stack. 
	Pushes size on stack. 
  - +tfree 
	Pull size from stack. 
	Adjust stack size down.
	Pull address
	Pull contents of zp register and copy to just pulled address.
